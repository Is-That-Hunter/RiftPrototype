//What I'm attempting to do here is make a script the object can refer to dictate its given properties
//To make it easier on the programmers and other members of the team for simplicity
//I'm making it so the User Interface inside the object will have a drop down menu based off of the JSON file
//Where the options they can choose is limited for each different attritubute to the item i.e (size, type, material)
//This hopefully will speed production and prevent potential typing errors
